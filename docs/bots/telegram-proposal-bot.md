# Telegram Proposal Bot

## Intro

Kjnodes team have built bots to keep validators notified when there is a new proposal on the chain. To distinguish mainnet from testnet we have created two separate bots that can be found by following links provided below.

[ü§ñ Mainnet Proposal Bot](https://t.me/kjnodes\_proposal\_bot) | **Supported chains**: 17 | **Users**: 140 | **Active subscriptions**: 226

[ü§ñ Testnet Proposal bot](https://t.me/kjnodes\_testnet\_proposal\_bot) | **Supported chains**: 27 | **Users**: 421 | **Active subscriptions**: 1331

## How to use

To start using the bot type `/start` command and choose the networks in which you want to get notified. ü•ù icon will tell you which network notifications are turned on.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently bots support chains where we operate our own RPC endpoints. List of supported chains can be found in the bot menu.
{% endhint %}

That's it! You are all set! Here is some example of the notification from the bot.
